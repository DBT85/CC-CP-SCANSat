    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry Scan of Mun
    description = With your recent success in getting us some preliminary altimetry data of Kerbin, our researchers have begged to see similar information for Mun. Get this right and we'll have some useful data for a Mun landing, not because it's easy, but because it is hard.
    synopsis = Send an unkerbaled vessel into Munar orbit, we guess you'll want to reach a 405km orbit with an 85.2 degree inclination, but you know, whatever. Scan Mun's surface with the SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor.
    completedMessage = Incredible, we have already analysed the early data and have found 73 different rock formations that resemble rocks! We'll be in touch.
