	// Any suggestions or corrections? Send me a note on http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/118151-DBT85
	// This contract only work with Contract Configurator and SCANsat 9.0
	
    name = ScanMinmus
    group = CCCP-SCANsat

    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry Scan of Minmus
    description = Heads up, Director. There is more work to be done. With the Kerbin scans coming along nicely and Mun scans underway, the team feel it's time we got some data about Minmus. We think it's very flat in places, but we'll know more once you've got us this data.
    synopsis = Send an unkerbaled vessel into a Minmus orbit and scan Minmus's surface with the SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor. \n\nThe guys in the tracking station have postulated a good orbit would be 74km with an 79.5 degree inclination, but they were drunk at the time.
    notes = Tip: There's probably some other science equipment you can take along for some extra science!\nTip: Don't forget to Analyse the Data from your scan once complete for extra science!
	completedMessage = Excellent work. As expected Kerbins second celestial satellite is very flat in places, with some bumpy bits. The guys are already preparing a party in the mess. Free Ice Cream!
