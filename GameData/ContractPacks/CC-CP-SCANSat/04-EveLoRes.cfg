	// Any suggestions or corrections? Send me a note on http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/118151-DBT85
	// This contract only work with Contract Configurator and SCANsat 9.0
	
    name = ScanEveLoRes
    group = CCCP-SCANsat

    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry Scan of Eve
    description = We've gathered some great data so far from Min and Minmus, but these were easy pickings compared to your next target. Get us something pretty to analyse from Eve. We don't currently know much more than "It's Purple", and frankly so is Valentina after too many Pan-Galactic Gargle Blasters.
    synopsis = Send an unkerbaled vessel into Eve orbit and scan the surface with the SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor. \n\nThe techs say an orbit of 455km with an 88 degree inclination should be best on this one, but one did think that that the collective noun for Tribbles was Trouble.
    notes = Tip: Always complete your optional part before your main part, if you choose to take the challenge on!\nTip: There's probably some other science equipment you can take along for some extra science!\nTip: Don't forget to Analyse the Data from your scan once complete for extra science!
	completedMessage = Splendid! The boys and girls in R&D are very grateful for your work and look forward to sifting through all of the data over a bottle or three of Kerbins finest Kanar.
