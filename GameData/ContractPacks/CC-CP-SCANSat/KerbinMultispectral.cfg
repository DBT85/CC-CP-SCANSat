	// Any suggestions or corrections? Send me a note on http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/118151-DBT85

    name = ScanKerbinMultispectral

    // Contract text
    title = Multispectral Scan of Kerbin
    description = Thanks to your grand effors in collecting science so far, the folk in R&D have managed to whip together a SCAN Multispectral Sensor from some old toilet rolls and some sticky backed plastic. Time to test it out and at the same time, retire the old Maxwell 1 Altimetry scanner we launched all those weeks/days/hours/minutes ago!
    synopsis = Send an unkerbaled vessel into orbit, reach a 495.2km orbit with an 79.78 degree inclination and scan Kerbin's surface with the SCAN Multispectral Sensor. You'll see a suggested orbit in the Tracking Station, but feel free to just hit the targets below. \n\nAlso, deorbit Maxwell 1 and let it burn up in the atmosphere.
    completedMessage = Stunning, through the advances with this scanner we have identified 9 different biomes for further study. I wonder if Mun has biomes?
