	// Any suggestions or corrections? Send me a note on http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/118151-DBT85
	// This contract only work with Contract Configurator and SCANsat 9.0

    name = ScanKerbinMultispectral
    group = CCCP-SCANsat

    // Contract text
    title = Multispectral Scan of Kerbin
    description = Thanks to your grand efforts in collecting science so far, the folk in R&D have managed to whip together a SCAN Multispectral Sensor from some old toilet rolls and some sticky backed plastic. Time to test it out around Kerbin and at the same time, retire the old Maxwell 1 Altimetry scanner we launched all those weeks/days/hours/minutes ago!
    synopsis = Send an unkerbaled vessel into orbit and scan Kerbin's surface with the SCAN Multispectral Sensor. \n\nWe suggest you reach a 495.2km orbit with an 84.21 degree inclination for the best results and the prettiest orbit path. \n\nAlso, deorbit Maxwell 1 and let it burn up in the atmosphere, if you can.
	notes = Tip: Always complete your optional part before your main part, if you choose to take the challenge on!\nTip: There's probably some other science equipment you can take along for some extra science!\nTip: Don't forget to Analyse the Data from your scan once complete for extra science!
	completedMessage = Stunning, through the advances with this scanner we have identified 9 different biomes for further study. I wonder if Mun has biomes?
