	// Any suggestions or corrections? Send me a note on http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/118151-DBT85
	// This contract only work with Contract Configurator and SCANsat 9.0

    name = ScanKerbinLoRes

    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry Scan of Kerbin
    description = Our scientists have suggested that knowing what the rock we're flying around looks like might ge a good idea. Perform an altimetry scan of Kerbin's surface and report back with the answer to the ultimate question, "Where did I put my keys?".
    synopsis = Send an unkerbaled vessel into orbit, reach a 496km orbit with an 79.8 decgree inclination and scan Kerbin's surface with the SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor. You'll see a suggested orbit in the Tracking Station, but feel free to just hit the targets below.
    completedMessage = Excellent work, despite the grainy monochrome image we've recovered our experts are very excited to see what they can find.
