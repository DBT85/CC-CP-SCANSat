    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry & Biome Scan of Moho
    description = Feeling a bit warm? You will be! It's time we started a mission to Moho to begin to learn about the makeup of the surface there. Its going to be a bit toasty that close to Kerbol and Bob already had his sun tan lotion ready to go. He was very upset when we told him no.\n\nTip: Take along some of your other science gear to earn more science!
    synopsis = Send a single unkerbaled vessel to Moho. Reach a 495km orbit with an 85.2 degree inclination and scan the surface with the SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor and the SCAN Multispectral Sensor. \n\nYou'll see a suggested orbit in the Tracking Station, but feel free to just hit the targets below.
	notes = Note: Due to the tidally locked nature of Moho, scans take considerably longer there.
    completedMessage = Brilliant! As we suspected Moho looks like it was subjected to extreme volcanic activity in millenia gone by. Herman has already opened a small shrine to Hephaistos, god of Fire.
