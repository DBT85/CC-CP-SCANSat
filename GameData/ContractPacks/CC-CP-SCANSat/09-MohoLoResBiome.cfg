    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry & Biome Scan of Moho
    description = Feeling a bit warm? You will be! It's time we started a mission to Moho to begin to learn about the makeup of the surface there. Its going to be a bit toasty that close to Kerbol and Bob already had his sun tan lotion ready to go. He was very upset when we told him no.
    synopsis = Send a single unkerbaled vessel to Moho and scan the surface with the SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor and the SCAN Multispectral Sensor. Your (optional) mission should you choose to accept it is to reach a 495km orbit with an 85.2 degree inclination for an optimum scan.
	notes = Note: Due to the tidally locked nature of Moho, scans take considerably longer there.
    completedMessage = Brilliant! As we suspected Moho looks like it was subjected to extreme volcanic activity in millenia gone by. Herman has already opened a small shrine to Hephaistos, god of Fire.
