	// Any suggestions or corrections? Send me a note on http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/118151-DBT85
	// This contract only work with Contract Configurator and SCANsat 9.0

    name = ScanDresLoResBiome
    group = CCCP-SCANsat

    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry & Biome Scan of Dres
    description = Our knowledge of the solar system is growing mission by mission and we're starting to get a reputation! Our nearest neighbors are now all under heavy observation so now we must expidite a mission to Dres.
    synopsis = Send a single unkerbaled vessel to Dres and scan the surface with both SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor and the SCAN Multispectral Sensor. The team in the coffee room have a bet that a 255km orbit with a 79.5 degree inclination should get the job done, but feel free to go it alone!
    notes = Tip: Always complete your optional part before your main part, if you choose to take the challenge on!\nTip: There's probably some other science equipment you can take along for some extra science!\nTip: Don't forget to Analyse the Data from your scan once complete for extra science!
	completedMessage = Dres turned out to be barely a planet at all, more like a large asteroid. Good work regardless. Getting this information was still valuble.
