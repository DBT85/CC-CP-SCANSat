	// Any suggestions or corrections? Send me a note on http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/118151-DBT85
	// This contract only work with Contract Configurator and SCANsat 9.0 or above


    name = ScanKerbinLoRes
    group = CCCP-SCANsat

    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry Scan of Kerbin
    description = Our scientists have suggested that knowing what the rock we're flying around looks like might be a good idea. Perform an altimetry scan of Kerbin's surface and report back with the answer to the ultimate question, "Where did I put my keys?".
    synopsis = Send an unkerbaled vessel into orbit, we suggest a 496km orbit with an 83.3 degree inclination, and scan Kerbin's surface with the SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor. \n\nThe key is getting the data we require, if you want to go with a custom orbit feel free but we didn't spend good money researching this one for no gorram reason!
	notes = Tip: There's probably some other science equipment you can take along for some extra science!\nTip: Don't forget to Analyse the Data from your scan once complete for extra science!
	completedMessage = Excellent work, we're well underway with our scans in in a short while, our first map will be complete!
