	// Any suggestions or corrections? Send me a note on http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/118151-DBT85
	// This contract only work with Contract Configurator and SCANsat 9.0

    name = ScanEelooLoResBiome
    group = SCANsat

    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry and Biome Scan of Eeloo
    description = Somewhere out there is Eeloo and we want you to find it before someone changes its designation to "Rock" from the already embarrasing "Dwarf Planet". The journey will be long and arduous, but the data we can retrieve would be invaluable to us all.
    synopsis = Send a single unkerbaled vessel into Eeloo orbit. Reach a 335km orbit with an 83 degree inclination and scan Eeloo's surface with both the SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor and the SCAN Multispectral Sensor. \n\nYou'll see a suggested orbit in the Tracking Station, but feel free to just hit the targets below.\n\nTip: Take along some of your other science gear to earn more science!\nTip: Eeloo is a long way from the sun, so you'll need more solar power to survive.
    completedMessage = Such a tiny planet. So far away. So cold. Excellent work, It's been so long since we embarked on this mission some of the engineers that launched it have had grand children!
