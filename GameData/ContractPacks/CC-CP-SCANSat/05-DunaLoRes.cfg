{
	// Any suggestions or corrections? Send me a note on http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/members/118151-DBT85
	// This contract only work with Contract Configurator and SCANsat 9.0

    name = ScanDunaLoRes
    group = SCANsat

    // Contract text
    title = Altimetry Scan of Duna
    description = Now that we have most of the data from Mun and Minmus the guys feel ready to get another launch on the way, hopefully you've started work on your Eve mission by now? This time to Duna! We've got all these spare rocket parts laying around so it seems like a good idea, and Bob just keeps chanting "Duna! Duna! Duna!".
    synopsis = Send an unkerbaled vessel into Duna orbit and scan the surface with the SCAN Radar Altimetry Sensor. \n\nVon Kerman believes that it would be best to reach a 378km orbit with an 84.1 degree inclination, but he is hardly an expert in rocket science!\n\nTip: Take along some of your other science gear to earn more science!
    notes = Tip: Always complete your optional part before your main part, if you choose to take the challenge on!
    completedMessage = Boy was that worth it! 17 different craters, 50 shades of orange and 4 dried up riverbeds. Astonishing!
