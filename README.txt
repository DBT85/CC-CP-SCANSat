# CC-CP-SCANSat
This is my Contract Pack for Kerbal Space Program which adds in SCANSat contracts using the Contract Configurator mod.

It's currently got 10 missions for Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, Eve, Gilly, Moho, Dres and Eeloo included.

All missions are currently unlocked, meaning that you can get them at any time. This is for my testing purposes. 

In future:
The first Kerbin mission requires that the first SCANSat part be unlocked
The Mun mission requires that some LoRes data has been gathered from Kerbin
The Minmus mission requires that more LoRes data is gathered from Kerbin and a little from Mun
The second Kerbin mission requires that the second SCANSat part be unlocked. Optional mission to de-orbit mission 1.
The Eve Mission requires that some LoRes data is gathered from Mun and Minmus. It has some optional parts too.
The Mun & Minmus mission requires some Biome data has been collected on Kerbin. It has some optional parts too.
The Duna mission requires that more LoRes data is gathered from Mun and Minmus. It has some optional parts too.
The Dres mission requires that 50% of Mun and Minmus have Biome data. 
The Moho mission requires that 65% of Mun and Minmus have Biome data. Comprises 2 separate ships.
The Eeloo mission requires that 95% of Mun and Minmus have Biome data. 

If using CKAN then it'll just go where it needs to.

If installing manually then copy the GameData folder from the ZIP to your KSP directory. 

Once installed it should appear thus
...GameData/ContractPacks/CC-CP-SCANSat

This Contract Pack supports KSP AVC, the automatic version checking mod.
