# CC-CP-SCANSat
This is my Contract Pack for Kerbal Space Program which adds in SCANSat contracts using the Contract Configurator mod.

It's currently got missions for Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, Eve, Gilly and Moho included.

All missions are currently unlocked, meaning that you can get them at any time. This is for my testing purposes. 

In future:
The first Kerbin mission requires that the first SCANSat part be unlocked
The second Kerbin mission requires that the second SCANSat part be unlocked. Optional mission to de-orbit mission 1.
The Mun mission requires that some LoRes data has been gathered from Kerbin
The Minmus mission requires that more LoRes data is gathered from Kerbin and a little from Mun
The Eve Mission requires that some LoRes data is gathered from Mun and Minmus. It has some optional parts too.
The Duna mission requires that more LoRes data is gathered from Mun and Minmus. It has some optional parts too.
The Moho mission requires that 15% of Kerbin has Biome data. Comprises 2 separate ships.

If using CKAN then it'll just go where it needs to.

If installing manually then copy the GameData folder from the ZIP to your KSP directory. 

Once installed it should appear thus
...GameData/ContractPacks/SCANSat

This Contract Pack supports KSP AVC, the automatic version checking mod.
