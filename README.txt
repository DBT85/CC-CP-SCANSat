# CC-CP-SCANSat
This is my Contract Pack for Kerbal Space Program which adds in SCANSat contracts using the Contract Configurator mod.

It's currently got Kerbin, Mun, Minmus, Duna, Ike, Eve & Gilly included.

All missions are currently unlocked, meaning that you can get them at any time. This is for my testing purposes. 

In future:
The Kerbin mission requires that the first SCANSat part be unlocked
The Mun mission requires that some LoRes data has been gathered from KErbin
The Minmus mission requires that more LoRes data is gathered from Kerbin and a little from Mun
The Eve Mission requires that some LoRes data is gathered from Mun and Minmus. It has some optional parts too.
The Duna mission requires that more LoRes data is gathered from Mun and Minmus. It has some optional parts too.

If using CKAN then it'll just go where it needs to.

If installing manually then copy the GameData folder from the ZIP to your KSP directory. 

Once installed it should appear thus
...GameData/ContractPacks/SCANSat
